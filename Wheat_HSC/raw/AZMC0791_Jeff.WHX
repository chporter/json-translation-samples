 Research leader for this experiment was Dr. Bruce A. Kimball
 Funding for the Hot Serial Cereal Experiment was provided by ARS and the University of Arizona.
 Prepared by Jeff White and Zahra Troeh, USALARC
 Based on data collected from "Hot Serial Cereal Experiment" designed 
 to assess growth response of spring wheat under a broad range of temperatures.
                           Study region
Field studies were conducted to determine the effect of elevated
 temperature on wheat growth and yield.  The studies were conducted from
 2007 to 2009 at the University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural
 Center, Maricopa, Arizona, USA (33.07°N lat.; 111.97°W long.; 361 m above
 sea level).  The soil was a Trix clay loam [fine-loamy, mixed
 (calcareous) hyperthermic Typic Torrifluvent] described by
 Post et al. (1988).
                            Crop culture
The spring wheat Yecora Rojo (Qualset et al., 1985) was sown every
 1-2 months, except during the summer, in an effort to grow the
 crop over a range of growing season temperatures.  Detailed temperature
 and other weather data for the duration of the Hot Serial Cereal
 experiment are presented by Wall et al. (2011). Growing wheat during
 the summer was attempted the first year, but competition from C4 weeds
 was intense, and the crop failed due to seedling death. Therefore
 no reliable crop growth data could be obtained, so we abandoned this
 effort in the succeeding years. The field plot area had previously
 been fallow before the present study was initiated.  In the second and
 third year of the study, plantings occurred where wheat had been grown
 in this study the previous year (e.g., Wall et al., 2011).  The field
 was prepared for each planting as follows: the ground was disked,
 ammonium phosphate fertilizer (16-20-0) was applied at a rate of 336
 kg ha-1, and the fertilizer was incorporated with a field cultivator.
  After field preparation, ‘Yecora Rojo’ hard red spring wheat was
 seeded into dry soil with a grain drill in rows 19 cm apart at a rate
 of 134 kg seed ha-1 (2.88 million seeds ha-1). The date the seed was
 drilled into dry soil is the nominal planting date, and the
 effective planting date is defined as the date irrigation water was
 first applied to germinate the seed as described in the section
 below.  Individual seeded blocks were 11 m x 11 m in size, and the
 useable 3-m-diameter plots in the center of the blocks were demarcated
 using rings of PVC pipe (nominal diameter of ½ inch) where the
 heating apparatus was erected and plant measurements taken.  
                               Irrigation
A surface drip irrigation system was installed after planting with
 drip tape placed 38 cm, between every other row.  The initial irrigation
 was intended not only to germinate the seed but also to fill the
 soil profile to field capacity to.  After the initial irrigation, water
 was applied weekly or bi-weekly based on normalized difference
 vegetation index (NDVI; Hunsaker et al., 2007).  The NDVI was measured
 two to five times per week using a hand-held radiometer (Model
 BX-100, Exotech, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD, USA).  The experimental area
 was irrigated with enough water to replace potential evapotranspiration
 less rainfall.  Following the initial irrigations, the heated plots,
 which are discussed below, received an average of 8% additional water
 from a supplemental irrigation system in order to account for
 increased evaporation from these plots and make the infrared
 heater treatments more equivalent to air heating at constant
 relative humidity as described by Kimball (2005; 2011) and Wall
 et al. (2011). The supplemental irrigations were applied at the same
 time as the larger field irrigations using a secondary small
 irrigation system superimposed over the larger one.
                            Fertilization
The amount of fertilizer applied was intended to prevent plant
 nutrient stresses.  Before planting, ammonium phosphate fertilizer
 (16-20-0) was applied at a rate of 336 kg ha-1 providing 54 kg N ha-1 and
 67 kg P ha-1.  During the growing season, urea ammonium nitrate solution
 (32-0-0) was applied at various growth stages in order to supply
 sufficient nitrogen for the growth of the crop.
                       Infrared heating apparatus
T-FACE (temperature free-air controlled enhancement) apparatus
 was placed in the crop every other sowing date. The apparatus consisted
 of six ceramic infrared heaters (1000W, 240V, Mor-FTE; Mor Electric
 Heating, Comstock Park, MI) arranged in a hexagonal array 1.2 m above
 the canopy as described by Kimball et al. (2008).  The heaters
 were suspended from cables in a triangular configuration and were angled
 45° from horizontal toward the center of the plot.  The heaters were
 raised weekly as the crop grew to maintain a height of 1.2 m above the
 wheat canopy.  Canopy temperature was sensed using infrared
 thermometers (Model IRR-PN, Apogee Instruments Inc., Logan, UT, and
 the heaters were controlled to achieve target temperature increases in
 the Heated compared to the Reference plots of 1.5 °C during the day and
 3.0 °C during the night.  The average temperature increases obtained over
 the course of this study were 1.3 °C during the day and 2.7 °C during
 the night (Wall et al., 2011), although the mode values were within
 0.1. °C of the targets (Kimball et al., 2011.)  The season-long
 average temperature increases were smaller than the target
 temperature increases because the apparatus could not supply enough
 heat during windy periods. Another reason is that the fall-planted
 wheat experienced frosts that damaged the wheat not under the heaters
 with consequent reduction in evapotranspirational cooling, so that
 during the daytime following the frosts, the heated plots from these
 two plantings were cooler than the corresponding reference plots even
 with the heaters fully on.
                     Crop Growth Measurements
	Each crop was sampled three times during the growing seasons
 for biomass and other crop growth parameters.  The stages at sampling
 were before flag leaf emergence, after heading, and final harvest
 between physiological maturity and harvest ripe stage.  An exception to
 the stages at sampling is the first sampling of the 21 Mar. 08
 planting which occurred between anthesis and the kernel milky stage.
  The first two samples taken during the growing season were from four
 rows, 0.46 m in length for an area of 0.35 m2.  These samples were
 taken toward the edges of the 3-m-diameter plots so as not to affect
 the final harvest areas near the centers of the plots (Fig. 1).  The
 final samples taken at harvest were from five rows, 1.0 m in length for
 an area of 0.95 m2.  The final harvest areas received no foot traffic
 during the growing season, and each encompassed a large portion of
 the viewing footprints of the infrared thermometers (Fig. 1).
	Plant biomass was estimated from the samples by drying in an oven
 at 65 °C.  The numbers of plants in the samples were counted, and from
 a sub-sample of five to 10 plants, plant heights and numbers of stems
 and spikes were measured.  For the first two sampling times, areas
 and weights of stems, green leaves, brown leaves, spikes, and crowns
 (weight only) were determined.  The yield of stems, green leaves,
 brown leaves, spikes and crowns was determined from the relative weights
 of these plant parts in a sample of five to ten plants multiplied by
 the yield of the whole plant sample.  Areas were measured using a
 LI-COR (Lincoln, NE) leaf area meter.  Stem and spike area indexes
 were calculated assuming that these organs are cylindrical in shape,
 and leaf area indexes was calculated assuming the leaves were flat in
 shape.  Plant area indexes were calculated from the sums of leaf, stem,
 and spike areas.  For the final harvest, grain weights, kernel weights
 and yellow berries per 10 g, grain volume weights, and grain moistures
 were determined.  Yellow berry in the kernels was determined by
 visual examination and is associated with low protein content.  Grain
 and total plant yields were adjusted to a 0% moisture basis.
  Harvest indexes were calculated as the ratios of grain yields to
 total plant yields.
